title: Hello World

### I'm Chris.

I'm a front-end web developer living in Raleigh, NC. I love building web applications. I'm in the process of changing my careers from pharmacy to web development.

### Why

I've been developing my own applications since pharmacy school in 2007. It's been my most consistent habit. It's almost like I was meant to do it.

So why didn't I do it?

Being a pharmacist in the United States has a certain level of comfortability. It's very well compensated and I already had the sunk cost of pharmacy school to boot. 

I didn't need to switch careers to enjoy development. I could do it in my free time and work on the projects I was most passionate about. I could create things that were useful to myself or my family. I could **create** things.

### Risk

To quote Jim Koch founder of Sam Adams [1][]:
> There are plenty of things in life that are scary but not  dangerous, and there are plenty of things in life that are dangerous but not scary.

> Continuing to do something that didn't make me happy, and getting to 65 and looking back and go, "Oh my God, I wasted my life."

> That is risk. That is danger.

### Enter Try Not to Lose

My idea for Try Not to Lose is to create a resource for getting into software development. There are career decisions that can be applied in a systematic testable way much like Test Driven Development. That's what Try Not to Lose is.

To lose is to not change my career. To lose is to not become a professional web developer. To lose is to get to the end of my life and find I had wasted it doing something that just paid the bills.

I will document what I do to become a developer and share what I've learned. 

Wish me luck!
